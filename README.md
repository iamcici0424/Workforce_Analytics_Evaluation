# Workforce Analytics Evaluation
* This project focused on the workforces &amp; analytics about the sample dataset: AdventureWorks. 

* The HR Manager wants to better understand how they are doing, and I was asked to answer HR's questions and develop some analytics/insights using the data file provided. 

* In order to better display the dataset, I created an Entity Relationship Diagram with 'datamodelr' package in `R`, merged *100,000+* data from *10+* tables, analyzed the data, and then generated the R-markdown report as well as the `Tableau` Dashboard for better interpretation and presentation.
